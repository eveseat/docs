# Webserver
The SeAT web interface requires a web server to serve the HTML goodies it has. We highly encourage you to use 
[nginx](/guides/installation/basic_installation/nginx) or [traefik](/guides/installation/basic_installation/traefik)
and these we will covered in the next few pages. You don't have to use it, so if you prefer something else, feel free.

## Guides

- [traefik](/guides/installation/basic_installation/traefik)
- [nginx](/guides/installation/basic_installation/nginx)
- [apache](/guides/installation/basic_installation/apache)
