# Getting Started

So you have decided to install SeAT, but without the [Docker](/guides/installation/basic_installation/installation/) or [SeAT tool](/guides/installation/basic_installation/installation/) helpers. Before you start it would be a good idea to review what you need first based on the [requirements](/general/requirements/) page.

With the requirements out of the way, you need to choose which guide you want to follow. We have a number of detailed walkthroughs for popular Linux distributions such as CentOS, Ubuntu and Debian. Those can be found below, or linked in the sidebar:

- [CentOS](/guides/installation/manual_installation/centos/)
- [Debian](/guides/installation/manual_installation/debian/)
- [Docker](/guides/installation/manual_installation/docker/)
- [Ubuntu](/guides/installation/manual_installation/ubuntu/)

Finally, if you have done this type of thing before or want to go completely solo, there is always the [manual](/guides/installation/manual_installation/manual/) installation guide.
