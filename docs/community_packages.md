# Community Packages

Below is a list of packages contributed by the community. These packages normally follow the same installation procedure, however, its best you consult the documentation of the package itself in case there is anything special you need to get it working.

## Blade package installation

Packages will normally come in the form of a composer package that you need to include in your SeAT install, as well as a Service Provider that you need to bootstrap. So, generically speaking, installing a package will mean that you:

- Ensure that you are in the *path* where you installed. By default, this should be `/var/www/seat`.

- Put your application into *maintenance mode*. This will ensure that no request from the outside will hit your applications logic, and also help you perform an upgrade uninterrupted. Do this with the following commands issued as the webserver user:

```bash
sudo -H -u www-data bash -c 'php artisan down'
```

- *Require* the package via composer:

```bash
sudo -H -u www-data bash -c 'composer require <package vendor>/<package-name>'
```

- *Publish* the assets with artisan:

```bash
sudo -H -u www-data bash -c 'php artisan vendor:publish --force --all'
```

- *Run migration* in order to update database:

```bash
sudo -H -u www-data bash -c 'php artisan migrate'
```

- *Renew config and route cache* to benefit of newly added functionalities:

```bash linenums="1"
sudo -H -u www-data bash -c 'php artisan route:cache'
sudo -H -u www-data bash -c 'php artisan config:cache'
```

- *Clear SeAT cache* after installation:

```bash
sudo -H -u www-data bash -c 'php artisan seat:cache:clear'
```

- *Seed schedule* so that new and missing commands get added to your schedule:

```bash
sudo -H -u www-data bash -c 'php /var/www/seat/artisan db:seed --class=Seat\\Services\\Database\\Seeders\\PluginDatabaseSeeder'
```

- Bring your application *live* and back out of maintenance mode:

```bash
sudo -H -u www-data bash -c 'php artisan up'
```

Installing packages like this will ensure that none of the core SeAT packages are affected and you should be free to upgrade SeAT core at anytime.

## Docker package installation

Applying community packages to your SeAT instance with Docker requires you to update your .env file located in `/opt/seat-docker` and uncommenting SEAT_PLUGINS by removing '#' and entering the package(s) to be installed separating each package with a comma. An example of how to enter packages in your .env would be:

```yaml linenums="1"
# SeAT Plugins
# This is a list of the all of the third party plugins that you
# would like to install as part of SeAT. Package names should be
# comma seperated if multiple packages should be installed.

SEAT_PLUGINS=denngarr/seat-fitting,cryptaeve/seat-squad-sync
```

- Once you have entered the package(s) to be installed run the below command in `/opt/seat-docker`:

=== "Docker (SeAT 4.x)"
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

=== "Docker (SeAT 5.x - using Traefik)"

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.mariadb.yml -f docker-compose.traefik.yml up -d
    ```

=== "Docker (SeAT 5.x - using reverse proxy)"

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.mariadb.yml -f docker-compose.proxy.yml up -d
    ```

After running the above command wait for containers affected to rebuild. If SeAT does not come back up refer to [Troubleshooting](https://eveseat.github.io/docs/troubleshooting/) for more insight.

### Installing different versions

Sometimes it can be useful to install a version different from the latest version, for example if you want to install an older version of a plugin or if you want to test a bugfix. The easiest way to find all available versions is to go to the packagist site of the plugin by clicking on the version in the available plugins list. On packagist, if you scroll down, to the right you will find a list of all available versions.

=== "Blade"

    Follow the normal installation steps, but change the `composer require` command to include the package according to the following example:

    ```bash
    sudo -H -u www-data bash -c 'composer require <package vendor>/<package-name>:<version-name>'
    ```

=== "Docker (SeAT 4.x)"

    In your `.env` file, add the version to the package like this:
    
    ```
    SEAT_PLUGINS=<vendor>/<package>:<version>,cryptaeve/seat-squad-sync:4.0.2
    ```
    Next, restart the stack as usual.
    
    ```bash linenums="1"
    docker-compose down
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

=== "Docker (SeAT 5.x - using Traefik)"

    In your `.env` file, add the version to the package like this:
    
    ```
    SEAT_PLUGINS=<vendor>/<package>:<version>,cryptaeve/seat-squad-sync:4.0.2
    ```
    Next, restart the stack as usual.
    
    ```bash linenums="1"
    docker-compose down
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.mariadb.yml -f docker-compose.traefik.yml up -d
    ```

=== "Docker (SeAT 5.x - using proxy)"

    In your `.env` file, add the version to the package like this:
    
    ```
    SEAT_PLUGINS=<vendor>/<package>:<version>,cryptaeve/seat-squad-sync:4.0.2
    ```
    Next, restart the stack as usual.
    
    ```bash linenums="1"
    docker-compose down
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.mariadb.yml -f docker-compose.proxy.yml up -d
    ```
