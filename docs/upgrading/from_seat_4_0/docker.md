# SeAT 4.x to 5.0 (Docker)

The upgrade path from SeAT 4.0 to SeAT 5.0 requires a tiny amount of manual work. 

!!! info    
    Before starting the upgrade, pay check the plugins you may be using and ensure that they are compatible with SeAT 5. 
    A compatibility table can be found on the [Community Packages](../../community_packages.md#seat-5-compatibility) page.
    If you are unsure, join us on [Discord] so that we can tru and assist or redirect you to proper person.

    Users of [recursivetree/seat-info](https://github.com/recursivetree/seat-info) need to follow separate instructions after the migrating the core to seat 5.

!!! warning
    Before you do anything, read and understand this entire upgrade guide.
    
    Those instructions are valid for Docker deployment only.
    Please refer to [bare metal instructions] for a non-docker installation.

    **Remember** to do make a complete backup of your current database making a copy off the server where SeAT runs together with the `.env` file. Both of these are the only things required to rebuilt your instance in case of failure.

## Requirements

- A database backup is an absolute **must**. Everything in SeAT can be recovered in some way or form except *for your database*.
- Enough storage space to have SeAT 4, SeAT 5 and a backup of your SeAT 4 database.
- Ensure all your SeAT 4 packages are up-to-date (check this in **Settings > SeAT Settings**)

## Docker Upgrade Procedure

If you are currently using a docker installation for SeAT 4, upgrading is easy as never before. You need to make a few changes to your docker stack configuration, restart the stack and your're good to go.

This guide is going to step through some quick preparation steps, then perform the upgrade and finally, check that everything worked out as expected. Let's dive in.

### tl;dr upgrades

We highly reccomend that you read the details of this upgrade guide to get familiar with what has changed. But, if this is your nth upgrade, maybe you just want to get the summary of everything, so here it is:

- Make a [backup] of your database.
- `cd` to your install dir (which is probably `/opt/seat-docker`) and bring the stack down with `docker-compose down`
- Make a copy of your `.env` file.
- Download the new `docker-compose.yml` file with `curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eveseat/seat-docker/5.0.x/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml`.
- Update your `.env` file: In the `# Database details` section add the following: 

  ```
  DB_CONNECTION=mysql
  DB_PORT=3306
  ```
- Bring the stack back up with `docker-compose up -d` and watch the migration process using `docker-compose logs -f front`.

### Docker changes since SeAT 4

There have been a few minor changes to the `docker-compose.yml` file. Most notably, the containers have been renamed to disclose their purpose easier, we have moved from Dockerhub to [GitHub Container Registry], and the stack now has a persistent storage volume.

If you customized your docker stack deployment, it is recommended that you take a look at the new `docker-compose.yml` file yourselves to see what exactly changed.

### Preperation

Before you upgrade, you need to backup.

#### Backup your database

The single most important thing you need is a backup of your SeAT 4 database. Without a backup you will *not* be able to recover in case of a disaster. So, head on over to the [docker db backup section] and do that right now.

#### Backup your env file

The `.env` file is the one that has your SeAT installations' configuration. It contains things like your SSO Client ID and Secret (aka: credentials). By default, SeAT docker installations live in `/opt/seat-docker` meaning your `.env` file will be at `/opt/seat-docker/.env`. Make a copy of this file and store it somewhere safe.

#### Stop SeAT 4

First, we need to stop the SeAT 4 stack. Assuming you have the default `/opt/seat-docker` location for your installation, cd to it first and then run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

The output should be similar to this:

```text
root@seat:/opt/seat-docker# docker-compose down
Stopping seat-web   ... done
Stopping seat-cron    ... done
Stopping seat-worker  ... done
Removing seat-traefik     ... done
Stopping seat-mariadb ... done
Stopping seat-redis   ... done
Removing seat-web   ... done
Removing seat-cron    ... done
Removing seat-worker  ... done
Removing seat-traefik     ... done
Removing seat-mariadb ... done
Removing seat-redis   ... done
Removing network seat-docker_seat-network
```

### Upgrading to SeAT 5

#### Get the new docker-compose file

!!! warning
    If you have made customisations to how you deployed SeAT with docker-compose, then you should probably **not** be replacing the compose file like we are about to do. Instead, have a look at the new one [here](https://github.com/eveseat/seat-docker/blob/5.0.x/docker-compose.yml) and adapt.

Next, we will download the new SeAT 4 docker-compose file. Do that with:

```bash
mv docker-compose.yml docker-compose.yml.seat4.back
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eveseat/seat-docker/5.0.x/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml
```

With this we have created a copy of the older docker-compose file (just in case), and downloaded the new one.

#### Update the .env file
This is one of the more important steps. The database configuration needs to be updated.

Somewhere in the file you have a section like this:

```text
# Database details.

DB_DATABASE=seat
DB_USERNAME=seat
DB_HOST=mariadb
DB_PASSWORD=i_should_be_changed
```

Add the following two lines:
```text
DB_PORT=3306
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
```

In the end, the section should look like this:

```text
# Database details.

DB_DATABASE=seat
DB_USERNAME=seat
DB_HOST=mariadb
DB_PASSWORD=i_should_be_changed
DB_PORT=3306
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
```

### Bringing SeAT 5 up

The only thing that is left to do is to start the stack up again. The first time we are goin to start SeAT 5 we wont use the `-d` flag. This is just so that you can see what's happening during the upgrade procedure. So, start SeAT with:

```text
docker-compose up
```

You should first see some download progress bars downloading the new seat version.

After a while, seat should start up similar to this:

```text
...

seat_local-front-1  | mysqld is alive
seat_local-front-1  | PONG
seat_local-front-1  | starting web service
seat_local-front-1  | Processing plugins from SEAT_PLUGINS
seat_local-front-1  | Installing plugins: recursivetree/seat-info:5.0.x-dev
seat_local-front-1  | ./composer.json has been updated
seat_local-front-1  | Loading composer repositories with package information
seat_local-front-1  | Info from https://repo.packagist.org: #StandWithUkraine
seat_local-front-1  | Updating dependencies
...
```

!!! warning
    Do **not** interrupt seat during this phase. It will leave your database in a potentially corrupt state, meaning you are going to have to do some extra pluming to get a backup restored. Not a train smash, but not worth it.

Eventually, when everything is done you should start seeing the following output:

```text
seat_local-front-1  | Fixing permissions
seat_local-front-1  | AH00558: apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 172.25.0.5. Set the 'ServerName' directive globally to suppress this message
seat_local-front-1  | AH00558: apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 172.25.0.5. Set the 'ServerName' directive globally to suppress this message
seat_local-front-1  | [Sun May 21 21:10:46.869842 2023] [mpm_prefork:notice] [pid 1] AH00163: Apache/2.4.56 (Debian) PHP/8.1.19 configured -- resuming normal operations

```

This is a good sign, and means everything is now ready!

### Check your installation

The first obvious step will be to check that you can access the web UI. If not, something is probably weird with the web server configuration and needs some tweaking.

If everything seems to be working fine, you can hit `crtl + c` which will bring the stack down gracefully. This might take up to 30 seconds.

```text
^CGracefully stopping... (press Ctrl+C again to force)
Stopping seat-docker_seat-cron_1   ...
Stopping seat-docker_seat-worker_1 ...
Stopping seat-docker_seat-web_1    ...
Stopping seat-docker_traefik_1     ... done
Stopping seat-docker_redis_1       ...
```

Then, bring it back up with the `-d` flag.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```


Congrats, and welcome to SeAT 4!
