# Getting Started

So you have decided to install SeAT, but without the [Docker] or [SeAT tool] helpers. Before you start it would be a good idea to review what you need first based on the [requirements] page.

With the requirements out of the way, you need to choose which guide you want to follow. We have a number of detailed walkthroughs for popular Linux distributions such as CentOS, Ubuntu and Debian. Those can be found below, or linked in the sidebar:

- [CentOS]
- [Debian]
- [Ubuntu]

Finally, if you have done this type of thing before or want to go completely solo, there is always the [manual] installation guide.

[Docker]: ../basic_installation.md
[SeAT tool]: ../basic_installation.md
[requirements]: ../requirements.md
[CentOS]: centos.md
[Debian]: debian.md
[Ubuntu]: ubuntu.md
[manual]: generic.md
