# Eve API Administrative Contact

## What
Requests to the EVE API need to have an administrative contact email set before SeAT will queue jobs to process. CCP made the request in this [Github issue]. To address this, the email address is added to the User-Agent string that is used when making EVE API requests as can be seen [eveseat/eveapi:Helpers/PhealSetup#L77].

## Why
The error `Failed to queue due to default config` is generated by [eveseat/eveapi:Traits/JobManager#L47-L56] check. In order for this check to pass, you need to configure the administrative email address in the SeAT configuration.

## How
Adding the email address can be done in two ways. Wither via the command line or via the Web interface.

### Web interface
The other method to change the admin email is via the web interface. You need to be logged in with a user that has the `superuser` role. Typically, if the email address is not set, you may notice the following warning on the home page:

To configure it, browse to *Configuration* -> *SeAT Settings* from the side menu, and set the email in the *Administrator Email* field.

### Command line
The command `php artisan seat:admin:email` will prompt you to add a valid email address for the administrative contact:
